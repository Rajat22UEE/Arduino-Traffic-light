# Arduino Traffic Light with LCD Counter Display

ðŸ”§ Project Overview: Design and build a functional traffic light system using an Arduino board, an LCD display, and basic electronic components. This hands-on project simulates real-life traffic signals â€“ red, yellow, and green â€“ with precise time frames shown on the LCD display.
    
Project Description:
The project simulates a traffic light system with three signals: red, yellow, and green. The LCD display shows the time remaining for each signal change.
