# Arduino Traffic Light with LCD Counter Display
This project demonstrates how to create a simple traffic light system using an Arduino board and an LCD display to show the time left for each signal.

Components and Supplies: 
1. Alphanumeric LCD, 16 x 2
2. 5 mm LED: Yellow
3. 3 mm LED: Green
4. Arduino UNO
5. Breadboard
6. 1k ohm Resistor
7. Jumper wires
8. 5 mm LED: Red
9. Tools and Libraries
10. LiquidCrystal.h Library
11. Arduino IDE
    
Project Description:
The project simulates a traffic light system with three signals: red, yellow (blue in this project), and green. The LCD display shows the time remaining for each signal change.

Video Demonstration
Watch the demonstration video here https://github.com/Rajat22UEE/Arduino-Traffic-light/issues/1#issue-2306843806.

How It Works
Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
The LEDs will start blinking according to the traffic light sequence (15s red, 6s blue, 20s green).
The LCD will display messages corresponding to each signal (e.g., "STOP" for red, "START" for blue, "GO" for green) and the time left for the next signal.
Usage
Ideal for beginners to learn Arduino basics.
Can be used to create a small-scale traffic light model.
Expandable by adding more LEDs or customizing the code for different timings.
Learn how to integrate an LCD display with Arduino.
Getting Started
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your Arduino board.
Follow the circuit diagram provided in the project documentation.
