# Arduino Traffic Light with LCD Counter Display
This project demonstrates how to create a simple traffic light system using an Arduino board and an LCD display to show the time left for each signal.

Components and Supplies: 
1. Alphanumeric LCD, 16 x 2
2. 5 mm LED: Yellow
3. 3 mm LED: Green
4. Arduino UNO
5. Breadboard
6. 1k ohm Resistor
7. Jumper wires
8. 5 mm LED: Red
9. Tools and Libraries
10. LiquidCrystal.h Library
11. Arduino IDE
    
Project Description:
The project simulates a traffic light system with three signals: red, yellow (blue in this project), and green. The LCD display shows the time remaining for each signal change.
